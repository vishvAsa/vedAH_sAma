The sAmavedic tradition has some gAna-s which today are termed "sUkta-s". Some of them originally were intended to worship the deity of the gAna. e.g., the raudra-sAman becomes rudra-sUkta; puruSha-sAman become puruSha-s; there is vaiShNava, sArasvata all their respective deities. However, the later vidhAna-s give some songs as skanda-prINana: there is no skanda in the sAma-saMhitA but the appearance of the word mayUra-romabhiH is used as a "match word" to claim the original song directed to indra (based on vishvAmitra's R^ik) for skanda. This association appears in the early sAmavidhAna.  
The later vidhAna-s give things like lakShmI-sUkta mentioned in the QT. These songs have nothing to do with lakShmI but are directed to indra -- the famous vairUpa gAna-s. The reason for the possible ascription to lakShmI is likely due to the "fertility" stobha-s like ashvA-sishu-mati yuvatish cha kumArinI that are inserted into the gAna . A southern reciter can be heard chanting the full song with these stobha-s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alU3lZZfpek
