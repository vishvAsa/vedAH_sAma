38. (But) not (if it is used) by Śrotriyas, ascetics, or royal officials. [^28] 


[^28]:  Haradatta adds that in the case of a Śrotriya and of an ascetic, the owner may allow the use of his property for a long time, desiring to acquire merit by doing so, and that fear may prevent him from opposing the king's servants. Hence prolonged possession by such persons does not necessitate the conclusion that the owner had given up his rights. As ascetics cannot possess any property, the Sūtra must refer to their occupying an empty house which has an owner.
