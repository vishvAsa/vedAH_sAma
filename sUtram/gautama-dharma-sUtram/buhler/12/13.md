13. (And if he abuses) a Śūdra, nothing. [^9] 


[^9]:  Manu VIII, 268. Haradatta adds that, as a Brāhmaṇa is declared to pay nothing for abusing a Śūdra, a Kṣatriya and a Vaiśya are liable to be fined for that offence, and that according to Uśanas a Kṣatriya shall pay twenty-four Paṇas, and a Vaiśya thirty-six.
