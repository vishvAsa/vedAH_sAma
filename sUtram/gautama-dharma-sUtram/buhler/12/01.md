1. A Śūdra who intentionally reviles twice-born men by criminal abuse, or criminally assaults them with blows, shall be deprived of the limb with which he offends. [^1] 


[^1]:  XII. Āpastamba II, 10, 27, 14; Manu VIII, 270, 279-283; p. 239 Yājñavalkya II, 215. Haradatta adds that an abusive word or a blow given in jest must not be punished in the manner prescribed above, as the word 'pāruṣya' presupposes criminal intent.
