1. Now, therefore, we will describe three Kṛcchras (or difficult penances). [^1] 


[^1]:  XXVI. Sāmavidhāna I, 2, 1; Āpastamba I, 9, 27, 7. Haradatta states that ataḥ, 'therefore,' means 'because the Kṛcchras cannot be performed if they have not been described,' while Sāyaṇa, on the Sāmavidhāna, asserts that it means 'because unpurified persons who are unable to offer sacrifices cannot gain heavenly bliss without performing austerities such as Kṛcchras.' It is a remarkable fact that Haradatta does not seem to have been aware that the twenty-sixth chapter of Gautama is taken bodily from the Sāmavidhāna.
