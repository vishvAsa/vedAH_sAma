44. And he who has begun to study (after the Upākarman shall not read) at night for four Muhūrtas. [^32] 


[^32]:  Haradatta explains this Sūtra as equivalent to Āpastamba I, 3, 9, 1. He adds that another commentator reads prādhītasya ca as a separate Sūtra, interpreting it to mean, 'And a person who has performed the Upākarman (shall not study after dinner),' and refers the words 'at night for four Muhūrtas' to the prohibition to read on the evening of the thirteenth day of the dark half of the month.
