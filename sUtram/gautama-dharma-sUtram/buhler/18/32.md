32. If the sacred law is violated and the (king) does not do (his duty), he commits sin. [^23] 


[^23]:  Haradatta refers this Sūtra to the case where 'a sacrificial animal or other requisites for a sacrifice are stolen from a Brāhmaṇa. It seems, however, more probable that it refers to the duty of the king to prevent, by all means in his power, a violation of the sacred duty to perform Śrauta-sacrifices, and that it is intended to prescribe that he is to assist a man who is engaged in them and too poor to finish them.
