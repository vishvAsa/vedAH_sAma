4. A woman whose husband is dead and who desires offspring (may bear a son) to her brother-in-law. [^4] 


[^4]:  Āpastamba II, 10, 27, 2-3; Manu IX, 59-60; Yājñavalkya I, 68. Apati, 'she whose husband is dead,' means literally, 'she who has no husband.' But as the case of a woman whose husband has gone abroad, is discussed below, it follows that the former translation alone is admissible. It must, of course, be understood that the widow has no children.
