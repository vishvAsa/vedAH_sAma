1. A wife is not independent with respect to (the fulfilment of) the sacred law. [^1] 


[^1]:  XVIII. Manu V, 155. This Sūtra refers in the first instance to the inability of wives to offer on their own account Śrauta or Gṛhya-sacrifices, or to perform vows and religious ceremonies prescribed in the Purāṇas, without the permission of their husbands. As the word strī means both wife and woman, its ulterior meaning is, that women in general are never independent; see Manu V, 148; IX, 3; Yājñavalkya 1, 85.
