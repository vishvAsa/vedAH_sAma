15. (A wife must) wait for six years, if her husband has disappeared. If he is heard of, she shall go to him. [^13] 


[^13]:  Manu IX, 76. 'When the husband has disappeared, i.e. has gone to a foreign country, his wife, though childless, shall wait for six years. After (the lapse of) that (period) she may, if she desires it, produce a child (by cohabiting with a Sapiṇḍa), after having been authorised thereto by her Gurus. If the husband is heard of, i.e. that he dwells in such and such a country, she shall go to him.'--Haradatta. Kṣapaṇa, 'waiting,' is ambiguous, and may also mean being continent or emaciating herself.
