10. Or at (the end of) any other (Vedic) sacrifice, provided that an Agniṣṭut (sacrifice) forms part of it. [^10] 


[^10]:  Haradatta names the Pañcarātra sacrifice as an instance of a Śrauta yajña, of which an Agniṣṭut forms part. He adds that another commentator explain s the Sūtra to mean, 'or at any other sacrifice, provided that an Agniṣṭut sacrifice be its final ceremony.' Regarding the Agniṣṭut sacrifice, see also above, XIX, 10.
