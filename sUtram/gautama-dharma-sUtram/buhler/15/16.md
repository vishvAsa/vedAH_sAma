16. Let him not feed a thief, a eunuch, an outcast, an atheist, a person who lives like an atheist, [^12]  the destroyer of the sacred fire; (the husband of) a younger sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose youngest sister was married first, a person who sacrifices for women or for a multitude of men, a man who tends goats, who has given up the fire-worship, who drinks spirituous liquor, whose conduct is blamable, who is a false witness, who lives as a door-keeper;


[^12]:  Āpastamba II, 7, 17, 21. 'A destroyer of the sacred fire (vīrahan), i.e. one who extinguishes intentionally the (domestic) fire p. 257 out of hatred against his wife, and for the like reasons.'--Haradatta. He also remarks that some read agredidhishu instead of agredidhiṣū, and he proposes to explain the former, on the authority of Vyāghra and of the Naighaṇṭukas, as 'a Brāhmaṇa whose wife has been wedded before to another man.'
