19. Nor, (sons) who have enforced a division of the family estate against the wish of their father. [^15] 


[^15]:  Below, XXVIII, 2, it will be prescribed that the division of the family estate may take place during the lifetime of the father with his consent. From this Sūtra it would appear that sons could enforce a division of the ancestral estate against his will, as Yājñavalkya also allows (see Colebrooke, Mitākṣarā I, 6, 5-11), and that this practice, though legal, was held to be contra bonos mores.
