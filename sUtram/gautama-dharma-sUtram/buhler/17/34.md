34. Woodpeckers, egrets, ibis, parrots, cormorants, peewits, and flying foxes, (as well as birds) flying at night, (ought not to be eaten). [^31] 


[^31]:  Manu V, 12; Yājñavalkya I, 173, Haradatta explains māndhāla by vāgvada, which seems to be the same as the bird vāgguda, (Manu XII, 64). Māndhāla is not found in our dictionaries, but it apparently is a vicarious form for mānthāla, which occurs in the Vājasaneyi-Saṃhitā and is said to be the name of a kind of mouse or rat, It seems to me that the large herbivorous bat, usually called the flying fox (in Gujarātī vāgud or vāgul) is really meant, which, by an inaccurate observer, might be described both as a bird and as a kind of rat. See also Vasiṣṭha XIV, 48.
