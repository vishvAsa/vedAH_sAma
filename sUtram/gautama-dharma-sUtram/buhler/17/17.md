17. (Food given) by a person who has been cast off (by his parents), by a woman of bad character, an Abhiśasta, a hermaphrodite, a police-officer, a carpenter, a miser, a jailer, a surgeon, one who hunts without using the bow, a man who eats the leavings (of others), by a multitude (of men), and by an enemy (must not be eaten), [^16] 


[^16]:  For this and the following Sūtras, see Āpastamba I, 6, 18, 16-1, 6, 19, 1; Manu IV, 205-217; Yājñavalkya I, 161-165. An Abhiśasta is a person who is wrongly or falsely accused of a heinous crime, see Āpastamba I, 91 24, 6-9. Haradatta adduces the explanation 'hermaphrodite' for anapadeśya as the opinion of others. He himself thinks that it means 'a person not worthy to be described or named.' 'One who hunts without using the bow' is a poacher who snares animals. Snaring animals is a favourite occupation of the non-Aryan tribes, such as Vāghrīs, Bhils, and Kolis.
