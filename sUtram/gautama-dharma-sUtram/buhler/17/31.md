31. Nor the flesh of animals whose milk-teeth have not fallen out, which are diseased, nor the meat of those (which have been killed) for no (sacred) purpose, [^29] 


[^29]:  Aitareya-brāhmaṇa VII, 14. For the explanation of vṛthā-māṃsa, 'the flesh (of animals killed) for no (sacred) purpose,' Haradatta refers back to Sūtra 19, but see also the Petersburg Dict. s. v. vṛthā.
