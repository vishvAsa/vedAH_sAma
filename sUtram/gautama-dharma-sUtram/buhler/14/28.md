28. And if the teacher, his son or wife, a person for whom (a Brāhmaṇa) sacrifices or a pupil (has been carried out, the duration of the impurity is) the same. [^16] 


[^16]:  Haradatta asserts that mṛteshu, 'have died,' must be understood. But as both the preceding and the following Sūtras. refer to p. 253 the carrying out of corpses, it is impossible to agree with him. It seems to me that Gautama's rule means, that, if a man has carried out the corpse of a teacher, &c., he becomes impure for ten, eleven, or twelve days, or for three days only. See also Manu V, 91, 103; Yājñavalkya III, 15.
