20. Likewise when a relative who is not a Sapiṇḍa, a relative by marriage, or a fellow-student (has died). [^11] 


[^11]:  Manu V, 81. Haradatta explains asapiṇḍa, 'a kinsman who is not a Sapiṇḍa,' by Samānodaka, i.e. 'a kinsman bearing the same family name, but more than six degrees removed,' and yonisambandha, 'a relative by marriage,' by 'the maternal grandfather, a maternal aunt's sons, and their sons, &c., the fathers of wives and the rest.' The latter term, for which 'a person related through a female' would be a more exact rendering than the one given above, includes, therefore, those persons who, according to the terminology of Manu and Yājñavalkya, are called Bhinnagotra-sapiṇḍas, Bāndhavas, or Bandhus (see Colebrooke, Mitākṣarā II, 53; II, 6). Gautama's terminology agrees in this respect with that of Āpastamba, see note on II, 5, 11, 16.
