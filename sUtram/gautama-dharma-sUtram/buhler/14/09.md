9. (The relatives) of those who are slain for the sake of cows and Brāhmaṇas (become pure) immediately after the burial, [^5] 


[^5]:  Yājñavalkya III, 27. The Sūtra may, however, also be translated 'the relatives of those who have been killed by a cow, or by a Brāhmaṇa, &c.,' as the latter case, too, is mentioned by Yājñavalkya III, 21. The word anvakṣam, translated by 'immediately after burial,' is explained by Haradatta as follows: 'The corpse is seen, i.e. is visible, so Iona; the meaning is that they will be pure after having bathed at the end of the burial.'
