23. On touching (i.e. on carrying out) a corpse from an interested motive, the impurity lasts for ten days. [^14] 


[^14]:  'The word upasparśana (literally touching) does not denote here simple touching. For below, Sūtra 30, bathing with the clothes on, will be prescribed for that, What does upasparśana then mean? It means carrying out a corpse. For that an impurity lasting ten days falls on the performer, provided that the carrying out be done for an object, i.e. with the intention of gaining a fee or the like, not for the sake of doing one's duty. The word impurity is here repeated in order to indicate that the impurity, here intended, differs from that described above. Hence the rules given below, Sūtra 37, which prescribe sleeping and sitting on the ground and so forth, do not apply. (The word impurity) indicates (here) merely that (the performer of the act) must not be touched, and has no right (to perform sacred ceremonies).'--Haradatta.
