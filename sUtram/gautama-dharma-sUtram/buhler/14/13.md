13. Sapiṇḍa-relationship ceases with the fifth or the seventh (ancestor). [^8] 


[^8]:  Āpastamba II, 6, 15, 2. Haradatta states that the Sapiṇḍa relationship extends to four degrees in the case of the son of an appointed daughter (see below, XXVIII, 18), while it includes the relatives within six degrees in the case of a legitimate son of the body. In either case the term refers to Sagotra-sapiṇḍas, or Sapiṇḍas who bear the same family name only. The case of the Bhinnagotra-sapiṇḍas will be discussed below, Sūtra 20.
