[^12]:  Haradatta explains sabrahmacārin by suhṛt, 'a friend.' But the term which elsewhere means 'a fellow-student' cannot have that sense in our Sūtra, as the fellow-student (sahādhyāyin) has been mentioned already. The translation given above is supported by the manner in which it is used in the ancient landgrants, where expressions like bahvṛcasabrahmacārin are of common occurrence.
