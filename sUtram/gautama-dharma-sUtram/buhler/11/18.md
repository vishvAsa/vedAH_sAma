18. Officiating priests (shall perform) the other (sacrifices) according to the precepts (of the Veda). [^16] 


[^16]:  Manu VII, 78-79; Yājñavalkya I, 313. Haradatta says that by the 'other' sacrifices, both Gṛhya and Śrauta rites are meant. I think that the latter are chiefly intended, as the Saṃskāras are included under the rites of festive days, mentioned in the preceding Sūtra.
