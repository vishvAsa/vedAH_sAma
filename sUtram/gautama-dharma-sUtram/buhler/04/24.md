[^21]:  'That is as follows: If the daughter of a Savarṇa, born of a wife of the Ambaṣṭha caste, is married again to a Savarṇa, and her female descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the offspring of that seventh female descendant, begotten by a Savarṇa husband, is equal in caste to a Savarṇa.'--Haradatta. Regarding the birth of the four castes from Brahman, see Rig-veda X, 90, 12.
