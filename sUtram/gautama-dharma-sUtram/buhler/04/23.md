23. The venerable teacher declares (that this happens) in the fifth (generation). [^20] 


[^20]:  '(The venerable) teacher opines that the change of caste takes place in the fifth generation. They declare that the plural may be used to denote one teacher. This Sūtra refers to (cases of extraordinary merit acquired through) virtuous conduct and study of the Veda.'--Haradatta. It is clear that in this case Haradatta, too, has seen that the word ācāryāḥ has another force than the more common eke; see above, note to III, 36.
