22. In the seventh (generation men obtain) a change of caste, either being raised to a higher one or being degraded to a lower one. [^19] 


[^19]:  Āpastamba II, 5, 11, 10-11. 'That is as follows: If a Savarṇā female, born of the Kṣatriya wife of a Brāhmaṇa, is married to a Brāhmaṇa, and her female descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the offspring which that seventh female descendant bears to her Brāhmaṇa husband is equal in caste to a Brāhmaṇa. In like manner, if a Savarṇa male, the son of a Brāhmaṇa and of his Kṣatriya wife, again marries a Kṣatriya wife and his male descendants down to the seventh likewise, then the offspring of that seventh male descendant is equal in caste to a Kṣatriya. The same principle must be applied to the offspring of Kṣatriyas and wives of the Vaiśya caste as well as to Vaiśyas and wives of the Śūdra caste.'--Haradatta.
