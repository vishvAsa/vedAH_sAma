18. Some declare, that a woman of the Brāhmaṇa caste has born successively to (husbands of) the (four) castes, sons (who are) Brāhmaṇas, Sūtas, Māgadhas or Caṇḍālas; [^18] 


[^18]:  The words 'Some declare' stand only at the end of Sūtra 21. But Haradatta rightly declares that they refer to all the four Sūtras. The proof for the correctness of his interpretation lies in the use of the form ajījanat, which refers to each of the Sūtras. The four Sūtras are, however, probably spurious, as Sūtra 28 refers back to Sūtra 17 by calling the Kaṇḍāla 'the last (named).'
