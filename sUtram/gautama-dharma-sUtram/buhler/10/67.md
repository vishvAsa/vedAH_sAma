67. If Āryans and non-Āryans interchange their occupations and conduct (the one taking that of the other, there is) equality (between them). [^41] 


[^41]:  'There is equality between them, i.e. the one need not serve the other. A Śūdra need not serve even a Brāhmaṇa, (much less) any other (twice-born man) who lives the life of a non-Āryan (Śūdra). A Śūdra, even, who conducts himself like an 'Āryan must not be despised by men of other castes, who follow the occupations of non-Āryans, on account of his inferior birth.'--Haradatta.
