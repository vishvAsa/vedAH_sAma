1. (The lawful occupations common) to (all) twice-born men are studying the (Veda), offering sacrifices (for their own sake), and giving (alms). [^1] 


[^1]:  X. Twice-born men, i.e. Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, and Vaiśyas. Haradatta says that some believe the term 'twice-born' to have been used in order to indicate that the three occupations may be lawfully followed after the second birth, i.e. the initiation only. But he declares that alms may be given even by an uninitiated Āryan, while studying the Veda and sacrificing are specially forbidden to him.
