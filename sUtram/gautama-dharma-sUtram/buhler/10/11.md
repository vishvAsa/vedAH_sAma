11. And those who are free from taxes, [^8] 


[^8]:  Haradatta takes this Sūtra differently. He says: 'The immunity from taxes which has been granted to Brāhmaṇas and others by former kings he shall maintain in the same manner as formerly! But I think that 'akara' must be taken as a Bahuvrīhi compound, and is used to designate widows, orphans, ascetics, &c.; see Āpastamba II, 10, 26, 10-7.
