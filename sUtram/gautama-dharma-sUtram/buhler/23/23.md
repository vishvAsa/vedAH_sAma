23. Let him who has eaten forbidden food [or swallowed impure substances], (fast until) his entrails are empty. [^16] 


[^16]:  -24. Āpastamba I, 9, 27, 3-4. My copies omit amedhyaprāśane vā, or has swallowed impure substances, and the words are not required, as another penance has been prescribed for the case above, Sūtra 3. But see also Sāmavidhāna I, 5, 13.
