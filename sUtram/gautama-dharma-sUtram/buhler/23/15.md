15. He shall cause the adulterer to be killed (also). [^10] 


[^10]:  Manu VIII, 372; Yājñavalkya III, 286; Āpastamba II, 10, 27, 9. My best MSS. read ghātayet, 'shall cause to be killed,' instead of Professor Stenzler's khādayet, 'shall cause to be devoured.' C. has khādayet, but its commentary, as well as that given in the other MSS., shows that ghātayet is the correct reading. The text of the commentary runs as follows: Anantaroktaviṣaye gataḥ pumān rājñā ghātayitvyo [khādayitavyo C.] vadhaprakāraścānantaram eva vasiṣṭhavacane darśitaḥ. The passages of Vasiṣṭha XXI, 1-3, which Haradatta has quoted in explanation of Sūtra 14, prescribe that the adulterer is to be burnt. Another objection to the reading khādayet is that the word would be superfluous. If Gautama had intended to prescribe the same punishment for the adulterer as for the woman, he would simply have said pumāṃsam.
