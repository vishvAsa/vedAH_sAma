27. For abuse, speaking an untruth, and doing injury, (he shall practise) austerities for no longer period than three (days and) nights. [^18] 


[^18]:  Āpastamba I, 9, 26, 3. My copies read trirātraparamam instead of trirātram paramam. This reading, which seems preferable, p. 291 is also confirmed by the commentary, where the words are explained, trirātraparatayā pareṇa trirātram.
