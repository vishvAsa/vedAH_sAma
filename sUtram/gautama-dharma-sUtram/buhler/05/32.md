32. But for a Śrotriya he shall cause to be prepared a foot-bath, an Arghya, and food of a superior quality. [^28] 


[^28]:  Āpastamba II, 3, 6, 7-10, 14-15. 'This Sūtra may be optionally taken as referring to a Brāhmaṇa, because the word Śrotriya is repeated. For a Śrotriya who has come as a guest, a foot-bath, i.e. water for washing the feet, an Arghya, i.e. water mixed with Dūrvā grass, flowers, &c., and food of a superior quality, i.e. milk and rice; cakes and the like shall be particularly prepared, if the host is able to afford it.'--Haradatta.
