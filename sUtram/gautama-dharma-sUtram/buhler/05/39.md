39. (The host shall show similar) though less (attention) to (a guest) who is inferior (to himself). [^34] 


[^34]:  Haradatta says that some explain this SÅ«tra to mean, '(The host shall show the same attention) even to a man who is a little inferior (to himself in learning, &c.),' but that he disapproves of their opinion.
