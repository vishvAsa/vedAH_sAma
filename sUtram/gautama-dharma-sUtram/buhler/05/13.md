13. To the deities of the dwelling inside (the house), [^13] 


[^13]:  'As he says "inside" (praviśya, literally "entering") he must stand outside while offering the Balis at the doors. At this occasion some require the following Mantra, "To the deities of the dwelling, svāhā," because that is found in the Āśvalāyana (Gṛhya-sūtra I, 2, 4). Others consider it necessary to mention the deities by name, and to present as many offerings as there are deities, while pronouncing the required words.'--Haradatta. The commentator then goes on to quote a passage from Uśanas, which he considers applicable, because it contains the names of the Gṛhadevatās. I doubt, however, if the 'others' are right, and still more if, in case they should be right, it would be advisable to supply the names of the Gṛhadevatās from Uśanas.
