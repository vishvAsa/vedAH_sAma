20. The reward of a gift (offered) to a person who is not a Brāhmaṇa is equal (to the value of the gift), those (of presents given) to a Brāhmaṇa twofold, to a Śrotriya thousandfold, to one who knows the whole Veda (vedapāraga) endless. [^18] 


[^18]:  According to Haradatta the term Śrotriya here denotes one who has studied one Veda, (but see also Āpastamba II, 3, 6, 4; II, 4, 8, 5.) Vedapāraga is a man who has studied one Veda, together with the Aṅgas, Kalpa-sūtras, and Upaniṣads.
