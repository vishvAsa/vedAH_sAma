17. And to the Beings walking about at night in the evening. [^16] 


[^16]:  'Because of the word "and," he must, also, present Balis to the deities mentioned above.'--Haradatta. The commentator means to say that in the evening not only the 'Beings walking about at night' (naktaá¹ƒcara) are to receive a portion, but all the other deities too, and that the Balikarma must be offered twice a day.
