14. To Brahman in the centre (of the house), [^14] 


[^14]:  'Because the word "and" occurs in Sūtra 11 after the word "to the deities presiding over the points of the horizon" a Bali-offering must be presented to the deities mentioned by the author in Sūtra 10, viz. to the earth, wind, Prajāpati, and to all the gods, after a Bali has been offered to Brahman.'--Haradatta.
