15. The four vows (undertaken) for the study of the Veda, [^11] 


[^11]:  The four vows, as Haradatta states, are, according to Āśvalāyana, the Mahānāmnīvrata, the Mahāvrata, the Upaniṣad-vrata, and the Godāna; see Āśvalāyana Śrauta-sūtra VIII, 14, where the first three are described in detail, and Gṛhya-sūtra I, 22, 3, with the commentary thereon. Other Gṛhya-sūtras give more and different names, see H. Oldenberg, Śāṅkhāyana Gṛhya-sūtra II, 11-12 (S. B. E., vol. xxix), and Gobhila Gṛhya-sūtra III, 1, 28-III, 2, 62.
