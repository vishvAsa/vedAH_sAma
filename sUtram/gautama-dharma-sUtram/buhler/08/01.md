1. A king and a Brāhmaṇa, deeply versed in the Vedas, these two, uphold the moral order in the world. [^1] 


[^1]:  VIII. Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa V, 4, 4, 5; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 29. Haradatta explains vrata, ' moral order,' by karmāṇi, 'the rites and occupations,' and loka, 'world,' by rāṣṭra, 'kingdom.' Ultimately my translation and his explanation come to the same thing. He adds that the king upholds order by punishing, and a learned Brāhmaṇa by teaching. Regarding the excellence of these two, see also Manu IV, 135.
