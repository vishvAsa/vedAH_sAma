20. A Brāhmaṇa (shall) always (abstain from) spirituous liquor. [^18] 


[^18]:  'A Brāhmaṇa shall avoid it always, i.e. even as a householder; Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas need do it only as long as they are students. But in their case, too, they forbid the use of, liquor distilled from bruised rice, under all circumstances.'--Haradatta.
