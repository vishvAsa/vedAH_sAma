28. If (his teacher) is walking, he shall walk after him, informing him of the work (which he is going to do and) telling (him what he has done). [^25] 


[^25]:  'Work (karma) means performance. The meaning is that the pupil shall announce to his teacher the performance of all he is going to do. But what is useful for the teacher, as fetching water and the like, be shall inform him of the performance of that, i.e. knowing himself (without being told) that such work is necessary at a particular time (and acting on this knowledge). Any other explanation of this Sūtra does not please me.'--Haradatta. See also Āpastamba I, 2, 6, 8. My MSS. divide this Sūtra into two, beginning the second with 'Informing' &c. Haradatta's final remark, quoted above, seems to indicate that the division was intended by him.
