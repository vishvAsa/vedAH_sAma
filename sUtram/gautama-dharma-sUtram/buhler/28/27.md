27. The heritage of not reunited (brothers) deceased [^26]  (without male issue goes) to the eldest (brother).


[^26]:  Colebrooke V, Digest 424. 'The word "eldest" is used p. 307 to give an example. (The property) goes to the brothers, not to the widow, nor to the parents. That is the opinion of the venerable teacher.'--Haradatta. Yājñavalkya II. 34.
