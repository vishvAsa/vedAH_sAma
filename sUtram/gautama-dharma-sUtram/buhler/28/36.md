36. (But he shall) not (obtain) the additional share of an eldest son. [^34] 


[^34]:  Colebrooke loc. cit. 'What is exclusive of the additional share of the eldest, which has been declared above, Sūtra 5, (that) other (part) he shall obtain. The verb must be understood from the context. Regarding a son by a Kṣatriya wife who is the eldest, but destitute of good qualities, the Mānava Dharma-śāstra declares (IX, 152-153), "Or (if no deduction be made)," &c.'--Haradatta. The sense in which the Sūtra has been taken above, agrees with the explanation of the Ratnākara adduced in the Digest loc. cit., though the reading of the text followed there seems to be different.
