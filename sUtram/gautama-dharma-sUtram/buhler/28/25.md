[^24]:  Colebrooke, Dāyabhāga IV, 3, 27; V, Digest 511; Mayūkha IV, 10, 32. 'The fee, i.e. the money which at an Āsura, or an Ārsha wedding, the father has taken for giving the sister away. That goes after his (the father's) death to the uterine brothers of that sister; and that (happens) after the mother's death. But if the mother is alive (it goes) to her.'--Haradatta.
