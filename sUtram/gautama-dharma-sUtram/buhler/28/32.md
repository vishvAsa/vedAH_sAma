32. A legitimate son, a son begotten on the wife (by a kinsman), an adopted son, a son made, a son born secretly, and a son abandoned (by his natural parents) inherit the estate (of their fathers). [^31] 


[^31]:  -33. Colebrooke V, Digest 184 Mayūkha IX, 166-178; Yājñavalkya II, 128-132. My best copy P. inserts another Sūtra between this and the following one, ete tu gotrabhāgaḥ, 'but these (latter six) belong to the family (only, and do not inherit).'
