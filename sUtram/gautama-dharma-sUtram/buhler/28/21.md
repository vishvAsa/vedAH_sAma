21. Sapiṇḍas (blood relations within six degrees), Sagotras (relations bearing a common family name), (or) those connected by descent from the same Ṛṣi [^20]  (vaidika gotra), and the wife shall share (the estate) of a person deceased without (male) issue (or an appointed daughter).


[^20]:  Colebrooke, Dāyabhāga XI, 6, 25; Mitākṣarā II, 1, 18; V, Digest 440. My copies as well as Jīmūtavāhana and Vijñāneśvara read in the text strī vā, 'or the wife,' instead of stri ca, p. 306 'and the wife.' Still the latter seems to be the reading recognised by Haradatta, as he says, 'But the wife is joined together (samuccīyate) with all the Sagotras and the rest. When the Sagotras and the rest inherit, then the wife shall inherit one share with them,' &c. Āpastamba II, 6, 14, 2; Manu IX, 187; Yājñavalkya II, 135-136.
