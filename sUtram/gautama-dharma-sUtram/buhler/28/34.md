34. On failure of a legitimate son or (of the) [^32]  other (five heirs) they receive a fourth (of the estate).


[^32]:  Colebrooke V, Digest 184. The residue of the estate p. 308 goes to the Sapiṇḍas. If it is here stated that the son of an appointed daughter receives, even on failure of a legitimate son, a fourth part of the estate only, that refers to the son of an appointed daughter of lower caste, i.e. to a son who is born, when somebody makes the daughter of a wife of lower caste his appointed daughter, and does that by intent only.'--Haradatta.
