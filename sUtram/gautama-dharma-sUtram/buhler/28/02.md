[^2]:  Colebrooke and Mayūkha loc. cit. Or the sons may divide the estate even during the lifetime of the father; when be desires it, i.e. by his permission. The time for such a (division is) when the mother is past child-bearing.'--Haradatta. The correctness of this interpretation of our Sūtra is corroborated by the exclusion of sons who have divided the family estate against the father's will (XV, 19) from the Śrāddha dinner. Āpastamba II, 6, 14, 1.
