9. Or let the eldest have two shares, [^9] 


[^9]:  Colebrooke, Dāyabhāga II, 3 7; V, Digest 51. My best copy P. leaves out this Sūtra and the next. The others read dvyaṃśī vā pūrvajaḥ (not pūrvajasya, as Professor Stenzler reads), and explain the former word as follows, 'dvāvaṃśau dvyaṃśaṃ tadasyāstīti dvyaṃśī.' Manu II, 117.
