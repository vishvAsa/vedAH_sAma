1. The law of castes and of orders has been declared. [^1] 


[^1]:  XIX. Haradatta, thinks that the object of this Sūtra is to assert that in the following chapter the laws given above for castes and orders must be kept in mind. Thus penances like offering a Punastoma are not intended for Śūdras, who have no business with Vedic rites, but other penances are. He also states that another commentator believes that the Sūtra is meant to indicate that the following rules refer not merely to those men who belong to castes and orders, but to the Pratilomas also, who have been declared to stand outside the pale of the sacred law. Haradatta's opinion appears to be preferable.
