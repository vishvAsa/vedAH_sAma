According to the same authority, the Madhus are found Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 38, the hymn of Aghamarshaṇa Rig-veda X, 190, the Rudras Taittirīya-Saṃhitā IV, 5, 1-11, and in the corresponding eleven chapters of all other Yajus-sākhās, the Puruṣasūkta Rig-veda X, 90, the Kūṣmāṇḍas Taittirīya Āraṇyaka X, 3-5, the Pāvamānīs Rig-veda IX, while by Atharvaśiras the Upaniṣad, known by that name, is meant. As regards the Sāmans mentioned in the Sūtra it suffices to refer to Professor Benfey's Index, Ind. Stud. III, 199, and to Dr. Burnell's Index of the Ārsheya-brāhmaṇa.
