14. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of Ṛṣis, cow-pens, and temples of the gods (are) places (which destroy sin). [^13] 


[^13]:  The word iti used in the text is, according to Haradatta, again to be taken in the sense of 'and so forth.' The translation of paṛṣkanda, 'a temple,' not paṛṣkandha, as Professor Stenzler p. 277 reads, is based on Haradatta's explanation. Etymologically it seems to mean 'a place for circumambulation,' and to denote the platform on which the temples usually stand, and which is used for the Pradakṣiṇa ceremony.
