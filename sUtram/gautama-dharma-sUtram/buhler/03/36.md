36. But the venerable teacher (prescribes) one order only, because the order of householders is explicitly prescribed (in the Vedas). [^21] 


[^21]:  'The duties of a householder, the Agnihotra, and the like, are frequently prescribed and praised in all Vedas, Dharmaśāstras, and Itihāsas. As, therefore, the order of householders is explicitly prescribed, this alone is the order (obligatory on all men). But the other orders are prescribed only for those unfit for the (duties of a householder). That is the opinion of many teachers.'--Haradatta. Haradatta's explanation of ācāryāḥ, which he takes to mean 'many teachers,' seems to me inadmissible. Eke, 'some (teachers)', is used in that sense, and ācāryāḥ cannot possibly be a synonymous term. Further on (IV, 23) Haradatta himself admits that by ācāryāḥ one teacher is meant. It must be translated 'the venerable teacher,' because the Hindus are very fond of the use of the pluralis majestatis. I have no doubt that Gautama means his own teacher, whom, of course, etiquette forbids him to name. See also R. Garbe, Uebersetzung des Vaitāna-sūtra, I, 3.
