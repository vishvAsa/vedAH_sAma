2. (The four orders are, that of) the student, (that of) the householder, (that of) the ascetic (bhikṣu), (and that of) the hermit in the woods (vaikhānasa). [^2] 


[^2]:  'Though the order of studentship has already been described above, still in the following chapter the rules for a professed (naiṣṭhika) student will be given (and it had therefore again to be mentioned). Bhikṣu has generally been translated by ascetic (sannyāsin). Vaikhānasa, literally, he who lives according to the rule promulgated by Vikhanas, means hermit. For that (sage) has chiefly taught that order. In all other Śāstras (the order of) hermits is the third, and (the order of) ascetics the fourth. Here a different arrangement is adopted. The reason of the displacement of the hermit is that the author considers the first-named three orders preferable. Hence if a man chooses to pass through all four, the sequence is that prescribed in other Śāstras.'--Haradatta. In making these statements the commentator has apparently forgotten that Āpastamba (II, 9, 21, 1) agrees exactly with Gautama. It is, however, very probable that Haradatta has given correctly the reason why the hermit is placed last by our author and by Āpastamba.
