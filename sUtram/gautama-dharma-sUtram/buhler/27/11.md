11. The sacrificial viands are, boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley, grain separated from the husk, barley-gruel, vegetables, milk, sour [^9]  milk, clarified butter, roots, fruits, and water; (among these) each succeeding one is preferable (to those enumerated earlier).


[^9]:  The term 'sacrificial viands' denotes here, according to Haradatta, the food eaten by the performer, which, like that eaten by the performer of a Kṛcchra, must be haviṣya, 'fit for an offering,' p. 302 see above, XXVI, 2. Haradatta adds that, as a Gṛhastha must not beg, the food obtained by begging must have been collected by his pupils, and that liquid food must be used for the expiation of the more serious offences.
