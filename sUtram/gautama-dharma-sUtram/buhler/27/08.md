8. Each mouthful of food must be consecrated by the mental recitations (of one) of the following (words): Om, bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ, austerity, truth, fame, prosperity, vigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, soul, law, Siva. [^6] 


[^6]:  Haradatta observes that on the days when the performer eats less than fifteen mouthfuls, the later mentioned texts must be left out, and that, while eating, the performer must employ the Prāṇāhuti Mantras (Āpastamba II, 1, 1, 2 note). He concludes by giving the following prayoga for the performance of the ceremony: He places all the food in his dish, and consecrates it by the texts "Increase," &c. Next he divides it into mouthfuls, and consecrates each successively with the word Om and the rest, and eats them, reciting the texts for the Prāṇāhutis.'
