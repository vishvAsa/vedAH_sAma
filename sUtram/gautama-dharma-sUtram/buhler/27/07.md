7. And at the end (of the offering of clarified [^5]  butter he shall offer) pieces of sacred fuel, reciting (the texts beginning) 'Devakṛtasya.'


[^5]:  'On completion of the oblations of clarified butter, he p. 301 shall offer pieces of sacred fuel, reciting the eight sacred texts, which begin "Devakṛtasya," and have been mentioned above (XXV, 10). The word "completion" (anta) is merely a confirmation of something established, because (the place of the offering) is already fixed by the place of the rule. But others explain the word "ante" to mean "at the end of the Cāndrāyaṇa." The word "and" does not agree with their (opinion).'--Haradatta.
