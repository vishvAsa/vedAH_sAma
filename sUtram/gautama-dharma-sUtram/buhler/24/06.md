6. The (secret) penance for killing a learned Brāhmaṇa (is as follows):, Living during ten days on milk (alone) or (on food fit for offerings), during a second (period of ten days) on clarified butter, and during a third (period of ten days) on water, partaking [^6]  of (such food) once only each day, in the morning, and keeping his garments constantly wet, he shall (daily) offer (eight) oblations, (representing) the hair, the nails, the skin, the flesh, the blood, the sinews, the bones, (and) the marrow. The end of each (Mantra) shall be, 'I offer in the mouth of the Atman (the Self), in the jaws of Death.'


[^6]:  Yājñavalkya III, 303. According to Haradatta the complete Mantras are as follows: Lomānyātmano mukhe mṛtyorāsye juhomi svāhā, nakhānyā. m. m. ā. juhomi svāhā, &c. This secret penance is apparently a milder form of that prescribed Āpastamba I, 9, 25, 12.
