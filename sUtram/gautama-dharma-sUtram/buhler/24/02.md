2. He who desires to accept or has accepted (a gift) which ought not to be accepted, shall recite the four Ṛk-verses (IX, 58, 1-4), (beginning) Tarat sa mandī, (standing) in water. [^2] 


[^2]:  Manu XI, 254. 'He who has accepted or desires to accept, i.e. because no other course is possible, (a present) offered by a man that is blamable on account of the caste of the giver or on account of his deeds, or (a present) that in itself is blamable, e.g. the skin of a black-buck and the like . . . in water, i.e. according to some, standing in water that reaches to his navel according to others, entirely immersed in water.'--Haradatta.
