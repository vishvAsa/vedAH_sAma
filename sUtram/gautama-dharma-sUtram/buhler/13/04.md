4. But a Brāhmaṇa must not be forced (to give evidence) at the word of a non-Brāhmaṇa, except if he is mentioned (in the plaint). [^4] 


[^4]:  Manu VIII, 65. 'A Brāhmaṇa means here a Śrotriya. If a man other than a Brāhmaṇa says: "This Brāhmaṇa is a witness of this fact," then the (Śrotriya) shall not be forced to become, i.e. not be taken as a witness, provided he has not been mentioned, i.e. he has not been entered in the written plaint (as one of the witnesses). But if he has been entered in the plaint, he certainly becomes a witness.'--Haradatta.
