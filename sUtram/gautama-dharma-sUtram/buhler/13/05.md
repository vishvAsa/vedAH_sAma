5. (Witnesses) shall not speak singly or without being asked, [^5] 


[^5]:  Manu VIII, 79; Macnaghten, Mitākṣarā VI, 1, 21. In the Mitākṣarā the Sūtra is read nāsamavetāḥ pṛṣṭāḥ prabrūyuḥ, 'witnesses need not answer if they are examined singly.' Mitramiśra in the Vīramitrodaya says that Haradatta's reading of the text is the same, and that his explanation does not agree with it.
