31. (Objects made of) bone and mud (must be treated) like wood. [^23] 


[^23]:  'Bone, i.e. ivory and the like. Mud, i.e. (the mud floor of) a house and the like. The purification of these two is the same as that of wood, i.e. by scraping (or planing). How is it proper that, since the author has declared (Sūtra 29) that objects made of wood shall be purified by planing, the expression "like wood" should be substituted (in this Sūtra)? (The answer is that), as the author uses the expression "like wood," when he ought to have said "like objects made of wood," he indicates thereby that the manner of purification is the same for the material as for the object made thereof.'--Haradatta. The p. 180 Sūtra is, therefore, a so-called Jñapaka, intended to reveal the existence of a general rule or paribhāṣā which has not been given explicitly.
