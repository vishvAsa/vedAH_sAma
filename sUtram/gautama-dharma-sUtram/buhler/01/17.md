17. Hempen or linen cloth, the (inner) bark (of trees), and woollen blankets (may be worn as low garments by students) of all (castes), [^13] 


[^13]:  Haradatta explains cira, the inner bark of a tree, by 'made of Kuśa grass and the like.' Regarding dresses made of Kuśa grass, See the Petersburg Dict. s.v. Kuśacīra. Kira may also mean 'rags,' such as were worn by Sannyāsins (see below, III, 19) and Bauddha ascetics.
