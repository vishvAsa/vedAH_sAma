27. (It is) optional (for students) to shave (their heads), to wear the hair tied in a braid, (or) to keep (merely) a lock on the crown of the head tied in a braid (shaving the other portions of the head). [^19] 


[^19]:  Āpastamba I, 1, 2, 31-32. The above translation follows the reading of my MSS. muṇḍajaṭilaśikhājaṭā vā, which seems more in accordance with the Sūtra style. It must, however, be understood that the arrangement of the hair is not regulated by the individual choice of the student, but by the custom of his family, school, or country. In the commentary, as given by one of my MSS., it is stated the custom of shaving the whole head prevailed among the Chandogas.
