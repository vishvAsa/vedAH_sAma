56. (All these acts must be performed) at the beginning of the instruction in the Veda. [^47] 


[^47]:  'All those acts beginning with the touching of the organs of sense with Kuśa grass and ending with the recitation of the Sāvitrī, which have been prescribed (Sūtras 48-57, must be performed before the pupil begins to study the Veda with his teacher, but should not be repeated daily. After the initiation follows the study of the Sāvitrī. The touching of the organs of sense and the other (acts mentioned) form part of this (study). But the rules prescribed in the three Sūtras, the first of which is Sūtra 52, and the rule to direct the eye and mind towards the teacher (Sūtra 47), must be constantly kept in mind. This decision is confirmed by the rules of other Smṛtis and of the Gṛhya-sūtras.'--Haradatta.
