46. Taking hold with (his right) hand of the left [^38]  hand (of his teacher), but leaving the thumb free, (the pupil) shall address his teacher, (saying): 'Venerable Sir, recite!'


[^38]:  This and the following rules refer chiefly to the teaching of the Sāvitrī, which forms part of the initiation. According to Gobhila Gṛhya-sūtra II, 10, 38, the complete sentence addressed to the teacher is, 'Venerable Sir, recite! May the worshipful one teach me the Sāvitrī!'
