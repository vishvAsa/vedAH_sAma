40. If they do become detached, he should know that he is purified by merely swallowing them, as (in the case of) saliva. [^32] 


[^32]:  'As the author ought to have said, "If they become detached, p. 182 he is purified by merely swallowing them," the addition of the words "he should know" and "as in the case of saliva" is intended to indicate that in the case of saliva, too, he becomes pure by swallowing it, and that purification by sipping need not be considered necessary.'--Haradatta. This Sūtra consists of the second half of a verse, quoted by Baudhāyana I, 5, 8, 25, and Vasiṣṭha III, 41.
