34. Or (objects) that have been defiled very much may be thrown away. [^26] 


[^26]:  'The word "or" is used in order to exclude the alternative (i.e. the methods of purification described above).'--Haradatta. For the explanation of the expression 'very much' Haradatta refers to Vasiṣṭha III, 58, with which Manu V, 123 may be compared.
