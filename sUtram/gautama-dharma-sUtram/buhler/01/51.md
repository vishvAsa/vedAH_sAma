51. The five Vyāhṛtis must (each) be preceded by (the syllable) Om and end with Satya. [^43] 


[^43]:  'In the Vyāhṛti-sāmans (see Burnell, Ārsheya-br., Index s.v.) five Vyāhṛtis are mentioned, viz. Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ, Satyam, Puruṣaḥ. Each of these is to be preceded by the syllable Om. But they are to end with Puruṣaḥ, which (in the above enumeration) occupies the fourth place.'--Haradatta, See also Manu II, 75 seq.
