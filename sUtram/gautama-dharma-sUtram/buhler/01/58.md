58. If (any one) passes between (the teacher and the pupil) the worship (of the teacher must be performed) once more. [^49] 


[^49]:  'The worship of the teacher (upasadana) consists in the performance of the acts prescribed in S큰tras 46-57, with the exception of the study of the S훮vitr카 and the acts belonging to that. The meaning of the S큰tra is that, though the worship of the teacher may have already been performed in the morning of that day, it must, nevertheless, be repeated for the reason stated.'--Haradatta.
