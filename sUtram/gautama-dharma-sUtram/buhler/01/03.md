3. Transgression of the law and violence ate observed (in the case) of (those) great (men); but both are without force (as precedents) on account of the weakness of the men of later ages. [^2] 


[^2]:  Āpastamba II, 6, 13, 8-10. Instances of transgressions of the law are the adultery of Kataka and Bhāradvāja, Vasiṣṭha's marriage with the Cāṇḍālī Akṣamālā, Rāma Jāmadagnya's murder of his mother. Haradatta explains the term 'avara,' translated by 'men of later ages,' to mean 'men like ourselves' (asmadādi). In his comment on the parallel passage of Āpastamba be renders it by idānīntana, 'belonging to our times;' and in his notes on Āpastamba I, 2, 5, 4, he substitutes arvācīna kaliyugavartin, 'men of modern times living in the Kaliyuga.' The last explanation seems to me the most accurate, if it is distinctly kept in mind that in the times of Gautama the Kaliyuga was not a definite period of calculated duration, but the Iron Age of sin as opposed to the happier times when justice still dwelt on earth.
