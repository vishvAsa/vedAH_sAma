36. Seated in a pure place, placing his right arm between his knees, arranging his dress (or his [^28]  sacrificial cord) in the manner required for a sacrifice to the gods, he shall, after washing his hands up to the wrist, three or four times, silently, sip water that reaches his heart; twice wipe (his lips); sprinkle his feet and (his head); touch the cavities in the head (severally) with (certain fingers of his) right hand; (and finally) place (all the fingers) on the crown of his head and (on the navel).


[^28]:  My MSS. more conveniently make five Sūtras of Professor Stenzler's one Sūtra. The divisions have been marked in the translation by semicolons.
