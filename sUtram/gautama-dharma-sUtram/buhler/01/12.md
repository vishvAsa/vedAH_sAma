12. Up to the sixteenth year the time for the Sāvitrī of a Brāhmaṇa has not passed, [^9] 


[^9]:  Āpastamba I, 11 1, 27. Sāvitrī, literally the Ṛk sacred to Sāvitrī, is here used as an equivalent for upanayana, initiation, because one of the chief objects of the ceremony is to impart to the neophyte the Mantra sacred to Sāvitrī, Rig-veda III, 62, 10.
