14. A contemporary who is born on the same day (shall be addressed with the terms) bhoḥ or bhavan (your honour), [^11] 


[^11]:  Haradatta says that samānehani, 'on the same day,' means 'in the same year.' He is probably right in thinking that the expression must not be interpreted too strictly. But his assertion that ahaḥ means also 'year' cannot be proved by his quotation from the Nighaṇṭuka, abde saṃvatsaram aharjaram.
