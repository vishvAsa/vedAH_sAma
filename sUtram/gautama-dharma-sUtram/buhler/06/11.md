11. (And) an Ārya, though (he be) younger, by a Śūdra; [^9] 


[^9]:  'An Ārya, i.e. a man of the three twice-born castes, though he be inferior, i.e. younger, must be honoured by rising, not be saluted by a Śūdra. The Śūdra is mentioned in order to give an instance of (a man of) inferior caste.'--Haradatta.
