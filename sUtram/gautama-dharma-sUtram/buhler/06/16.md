16. (Also) an artist who is five years (older), [^13] 


[^13]:  'The words "years older" must be understood. He who lives by the fine arts (kalā), i.e. the knowledge of music, painting leaf-cutting, and the like, and is at least five years older than oneself, must be addressed as bhoḥ or bhavan.'--Haradatta.
