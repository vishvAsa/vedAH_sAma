10. In like manner (any) other aged fellow-citizen, even a Śūdra of eighty years and more, (must be honoured) by one young enough to be his son, [^8] 


[^8]:  'Old (pūrva), i.e. of greater age. . A Śūdra even, who answers this description, must be honoured by rising, not, however, be saluted by one young enough to be his son, i.e. by a Brāhmaṇa who is very much younger. The Śūdra is mentioned as an instance of a man of inferior caste. Hence a Śūdra must (under these circumstances) be honoured by rising, not be saluted by men of the three higher castes, a Vaiśya by those of the two higher castes, and a Kṣatriya by a Brāhmaṇa.'--Haradatta.
