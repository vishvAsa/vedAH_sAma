20. Wealth, relations, occupation, birth, learning, and age must be honoured; (but) each later named [^16]  (quality) is more important (than the preceding ones).


[^16]:  Manu II, 136. 'As wealth and the rest cannot be directly honoured, the persons possessing them are to be honoured . . . . . Respect (māna) means honour shown by saluting and the like.'--Haradatta.
