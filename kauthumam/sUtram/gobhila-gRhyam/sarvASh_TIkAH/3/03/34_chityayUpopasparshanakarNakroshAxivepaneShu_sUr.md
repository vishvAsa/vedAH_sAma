34. [^17]  If he has touched a piled-up (fire-altar) or a sacrificial post, or if he has humming in his ears, or if his eye palpitates, or if the sun rises or sets while he is sleeping, or if his organs of sense have been defiled by something bad, let him sacrifice two Ājya oblations with the two verses, 'May my strength return to me' (Mantra-Brāhmaṇa I, 6, 33. 34).


[^17]:  Citya means Citya agni, the piled-up fire-altar, the construction of which is treated of, for instance, in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa VI-X. Prof. Weber has devoted to the rites connected with the citya agni a very detailed paper, Indische Studien, XIII, 217 seq. That citya does not mean here anything different from citya agni is shown by the Mānava-Gṛhya I, 3: yadi . . . akṣi vā spandet karṇo vā krośed agniṃ vā cityam ārohet śmaśānaṃ vā gacched yūpaṃ vopaspṛśet, &c.
