6. [^4]  They eat fried barley-grains with (the verse), 'That which is accompanied by grains and by a karambha (i.e. curds with flour)' (Sāma-veda I, 2 10).


[^4]:  It is not quite clear from the text, in what connection the rites described in Sūtras 6-8 stand with those treated of in the preceding Sūtras. The expression yathārtham used in Sūtra 5 ('yathārtham iti karmaṇaḥ parisamāptir ucyate,' Comm.; comp. above, I, 3, 12 note) clearly indicates the close of the ceremony; on the other hand the comparison of Pāraskara II, 10, 15 seq., Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 10 seq., Āśvalāyana III, 5, 10, seems to show that the acts stated in Sūtras 6-8 form part of the ceremony described before.
