8. [^5]  After they have sipped water, (the teacher) should cause them to repeat the first (?) verses, and to sing the first (?) Sāmans, of the different sections (?).


[^5]:  I do not try to translate this very obscure Sūtra according to the commentary, in which khāṇḍika is explained as 'the number (of pupils).' Perhaps the word is a misspelling for kaṇḍikā or the like, and means sections of the texts. Comp. Khādira-Gṛhya III, 2, 23. The construction (ācāntodakāḥ . . . kārayet) is quite irregular.
