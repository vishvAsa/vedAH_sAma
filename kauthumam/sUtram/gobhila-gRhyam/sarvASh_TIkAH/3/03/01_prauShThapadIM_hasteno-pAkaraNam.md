1. [^1]  On the full-moon day of Prauṣṭhapada (or) under (the Nakṣatra) Hasta the Upākaraṇa (or opening ceremony of the annual term of Veda-study, is performed).


[^1]:  3, 1 seq. The Upākaraṇa ceremony; Khādira-Gṛhya III, 2, 16 seq. Regarding the different terms for this ceremony, comp. Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 2; Āśvalāyana III, 5, 3; Pāraskara II, 10, 2. Hiraṇyakeśin says: śravaṇāpakṣa oṣadhīṣu jātāsu hastena paurṇamāsyāṃ vādhyāyopākarma.It seems impossible to me to adopt an explanation of this Sūtra, which gives to prauṣṭhapadī another meaning than that based on the constant use of these feminines derived from the names of Nakṣatras, i.e. the day of the full moon which falls under such or such a Nakṣatra. Hasten a, therefore, necessarily refers to another day besides the Prauṣṭhapadī, on which the Upākaraṇa may be celebrated. Perhaps we may conjecture, prauṣṭhapadīṃ hastena vopākaraṇam.
