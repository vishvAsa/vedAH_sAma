30. [^7]  The Āditya-vrata, however, some do not undergo.


[^7]:  According to the commentary some study the Śukriyas as a part of the Āraṇyaka; these do not undergo the Āditya-vrata. Others, for instance the Kauthumas, separate the Śukriyas from the Āraṇyaka and keep a special vow, the Āditya-vrata, by which they are enabled to study those texts.
