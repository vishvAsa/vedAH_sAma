33. [^5]  Nor alone,


[^5]:  That the Snātaka is not allowed to go alone to another village, follows from Sacra 36; thus Sūtra 33 is superfluous. The commentator of course tries to defend Gobhila, but I think he has not succeeded. Probably Gobhila has taken the two Sūtras from different texts on which his own composition seems to be based.
