1. [^1]  To the north of the place (in which the Arghya reception will be offered to a guest), they should bind a cow (to a post or the like), and should (reverentially) approach it with (the verse), 'Arhaṇā putra vāsa' (MB. II, 8, 1).


[^1]:  10, 1 seq. The Arghya reception; Khādira-Gṛhya IV, 4, 5 seq.; Gṛhya-saṃgraha II, 62-65. The first words of the Mantra quoted in Sūtra 1 are corrupt. The Mantra is evidently an adaptation of the well-known verse addressed to the Āgrahāyaṇī (Gobhila III, 9, 9; Mantra-Brāhmaṇa II, 2, 1), or to the Aṣṭakā (Pāraskara III, 3, 5, 8): prathamā ha vyuvāsa, &c. The first word arhaṇā ('duly'), containing an allusion to the occasion of the Arghya ceremony, to which this Mantra is adapted, seems to be quite right; the third word may be, as Dr. Knauer conjectures, uvāsa ('she has dwelt,' or perhaps rather 'she has shone'). For the second word I am not able to suggest a correction.
