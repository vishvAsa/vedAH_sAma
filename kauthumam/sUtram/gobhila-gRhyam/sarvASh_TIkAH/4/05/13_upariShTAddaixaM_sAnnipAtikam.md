13. [^7]  (At a ceremony) which ought to be performed immediately (after the occurrence by which it has been caused), the consecration follows after (the ceremony itself).


[^7]:  My translation of this Sūtra differs from the commentary. There it is said: 'An occurrence which is perceived only when it has happened (sannipatitam eva), and of which the cause by which it is produced is unknown, for instance the appearance of a halo, is called sānnipātika. Such sānnipātika ceremonies are upaṛṣṭāddaikṣa. The dīkṣā is the preparatory consecration (of the sacrificer), for instance by three days of fasting. A ceremony which has its dīkṣā after itself is called upaṛṣṭāddaikṣa.' Similarly the commentary on Khādira-Gṛhya IV, 1, 3 says, 'upaṛṣṭāt sānnipātike naimittike karma kṛtvābhojanam.'
