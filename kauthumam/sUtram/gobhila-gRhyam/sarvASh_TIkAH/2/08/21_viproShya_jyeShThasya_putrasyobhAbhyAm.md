21. [^9]  When (the father) returns from a journey, or when (the son) begins to know, 'This is my father,' or when (the son) has been initiated, (the father) should grasp with his two hands his son round the head, and should murmur, 'From limb by limb thou art produced' (MB. I, 5, 16-18).


[^9]:  21 seq. The father's returning from a journey. Khādira-Gṛhya II, 3,13 seq. As to upeta, comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya II, I, 1 note. The position of the words in Sūtra 21 is irregular, so as to raise the suspicion that the words yadā vā. . . . upetasya vi ('or when the son begins to know . . . has been initiated') are an insertion into the text of Gobhila, made by a later compiler, or into a more ancient text, made by Gobhila himself. Comp. Pāraskara I, 18.
