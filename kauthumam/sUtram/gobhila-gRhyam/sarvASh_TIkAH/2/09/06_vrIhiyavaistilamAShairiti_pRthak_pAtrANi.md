6. [^4]  Let them fill vessels separately with rice and barley, with sesamum seeds and beans, and let them place (those vessels) to the east (of the fire).


[^4]:  I believe that four vessels were filled, one with rice, one with barley, one with sesamum seeds, and one with beans. The Dvandva compounds vrīhiyavais and tilamāṣais cannot justify the conclusion that one vessel was filled with rice and barley mixed, and another with sesamum seeds and beans, for the plural pātrāṇi shows that there were more than two vessels. Āśvalāyana I, 17, 2, says, vrīhiyavamāṣatilānāṃ pṛthak pūrṇaśarāvāṇi.
