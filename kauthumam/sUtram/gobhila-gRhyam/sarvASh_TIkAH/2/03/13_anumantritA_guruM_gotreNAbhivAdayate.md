13. [^5]  After she has been addressed (thus), she respectfully calls her Guru by his Gotra name.


[^5]:  'Her Guru' means, according to the commentary, her husband. The commentary quotes the well-known sentence: patir eko guruḥ strīṇām. Perhaps we may also take the Guru for the Brāhmaṇa in whose house they stay. Comp. also chap. 4, 11.
