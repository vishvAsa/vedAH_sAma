22. [^8]  In (the words), 'What is thy name' (ibid. 17), he asks after his name.


[^8]:  22, 23. It is evident that the words tasyācāryaḥ belong to Sūtra 23, and not to Sūtra 22, to which the traditional division of the Sūtras assigns them. The corresponding section of the Mantra-Brāhmaṇa runs thus: 'What is thy name?''My name is N.N.!' It is not clear whether the student, being questioned by the teacher, had to indicate his ordinary name, and then to receive from the teacher his 'abhivādanīya nāmadheya,' or whether he had to pronounce, on the teacher's question, directly the abhivādanīya name chosen for him by the teacher. The commentary and the corresponding passage of the Khādira-Gṛhya (II, 4, 12) are in favour of the second alternative.
