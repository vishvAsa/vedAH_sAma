19. [^10]  After he has sacrificed, he should throw that pot-ladle (which he has used in the preceding ceremonies) into the fire.


[^10]:  According to the commentary, etad would belong to sauviṣṭakṛtam (Sūtra 18): 'After he has sacrificed that, he should throw the pot-ladle into the fire.' The comparison of Baudhāyana 1, 17, 23, atraitan mekṣaṇam āhavanīveऽnupraharati (Hillebrandt, p. 119, note 3), shows that the commentary is wrong, and that etad belongs to mekṣaṇam.
