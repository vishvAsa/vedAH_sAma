27. [^12]  At Ājya oblations he should, if no special rule is given, sacrifice with the Mahāvyāhṛtis before and after (the chief ceremonies).


[^12]:  Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 12, 13; Khādira-Gṛhya I, 3, 12-13, where the traditional division of the Sūtras differs from that which is supported by tradition in the text of Gobhila. Gobhila has used p. 41 the word ājyāhutishu in the beginning of Sūtra 26, and it would have been superfluous if he had repeated it in connection with the words nājyabhāgau na sviṣṭakṛt. In the corresponding Sūtras of the Khādira the case was different, and there the words nājyabhāgau na sviṣṭakṛt inevitably required the addition of a word like ājyāhutishu, by which to show which class of sacrifices it was which required no Ājyabhāgas and no Sviṣṭakṛt. The following word in the Khādira text, however, anādeśe, should be referred, against tradition, to Sūtra 13, as is shown by the comparison of Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 12, 13.
