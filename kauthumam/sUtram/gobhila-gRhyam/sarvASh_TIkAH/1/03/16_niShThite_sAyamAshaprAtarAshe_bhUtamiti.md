16. [^10]  When the morning meal or the evening meal is ready, he should make (his wife) say, 'It is ready!'


[^10]:  16-18. Khādira-Gṛhya, l.l. 18, 19. In my translation of Sūtra 17 I have adopted, though not quite without doubt, the conjecture of Professor Roth given in Professor Knauer's note, p. 137. Professor Roth writes ṛtebhaṅgayā vācā or ṛtebhagayā vācā: he says simply 'om,' and not 'ó-o-ó-o-ó-om.' According to the commentary Sūtra 17 would refer to the wife, not to the husband.
