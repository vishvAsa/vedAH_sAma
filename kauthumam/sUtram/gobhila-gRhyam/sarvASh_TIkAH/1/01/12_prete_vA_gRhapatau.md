12. [^6]  Or after the householder has died, the chief (of the family) should do it (i.e. he should set up the sacred fire).


[^6]:  I have followed in the translation of parameṣṭhikaraṇam the p. 15 way indicated by the Gṛhya-saṃgraha I, 77, and by Śāṅkhāyana (I, 1, 5): prete vā gṛhapatau svayaṃ jyāyān. I think the parameṣṭhī is the same person as the jyāyan. The commentary gives a different explanation: parameṣṭhī agnir ity ācakṣate, tasya parameṣṭhinoऽgneḥ karaṇaṃ yathoktena vidhinā svīkaraṇam.
