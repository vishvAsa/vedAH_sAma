1. [^fn_300] A student, after he has studied the Veda,

[^fn_300]: 4, 1 seq. The description given in this chapter of the Samāvartana, or of the ceremony performed at the end of studentship, is opened with a few sentences referring to another section of the Gr̥hya ritual, namely, to marriage. It seems to me that these first Sūtras of this chapter once formed, in a text from which Gobhila has taken them, the introduction to an exposition of the wedding ceremonies, and that Gobhila was induced to transfer them to the description of the Samāvartana, by their opening words, 'A student, after he has studied the Veda, &c.' With Sūtras 1-3, comp. Khādira-Gr̥hya I, 3, 1.
